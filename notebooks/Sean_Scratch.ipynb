            "Sample 1: {'text': 'It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\\n\\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\\n\\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\\n\\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\\n\\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\\n\\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\\n\\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\\n\\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\\n\\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\\n\\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\\n\\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\\n\\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\\n\\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\\n\\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\\n\\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\\n\\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\\n\\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\\n\\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\\n\\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\\n\\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\\n\\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\\n\\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\\n\\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\\n\\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\\n\\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\\n\\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\\n\\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\\n\\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\\n\\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\\n\\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\\n\\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\\n\\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\\n\\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\\n\\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\\n\\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\\n\\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\\n\\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\\n\\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\\n\\nArgument and user experience\\n\\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare.

            "Sample 6: {'text': 'Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\\n\\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\\n\\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\\n\\nDecree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922\\n\\nDecree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931\\n\\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\\n\\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\\n\\nFor the provision:\\n• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health\\n• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\\n• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\\n• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\\n• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\\n• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\\n\\nAgainst the provision:\\n• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\\n• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\\n• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\\n• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\\n• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\\n\\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\\n\\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.

            "{'text': 'It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\\n\\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\\n\\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\\n\\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\\n\\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\\n\\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\\n\\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\\n\\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\\n\\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\\n\\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\\n\\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\\n\\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\\n\\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\\n\\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\\n\\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\\n\\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\\n\\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\\n\\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\\n\\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\\n\\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\\n\\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\\n\\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\\n\\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\\n\\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\\n\\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\\n\\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\\n\\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\\n\\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\\n\\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\\n\\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\\n\\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\\n\\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\\n\\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\\n\\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\\n\\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\\n\\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\\n\\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\\n\\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\\n\\nArgument and user experience\\n\\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.\\n\\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\\n\\nI’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\\n\\nThis entry was posted\\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

from the same team are around if pasta from other team are around though they get locked down in their attempt unable to conquer the plate until one of them die think battlefields standard conquest mode you get points every second for every plate you own over time the concept also evolved to use an italian bistro as its main scenario carlos carlos bistros founder and owner setup no major changes were made from my work setup i used fdt and starling creating an adobe air actionscript project all tools or frameworks i already had some knowledge with one big change for me was that i livestreamed my work through a twitchtv account this was a new thing for me as recommended by roushey i used a program called xsplit and i got to say it is pretty amazing it made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome even for the free version it was great to have some of my friends watch me and then interact with them and random people through chat it was also good knowing that i was also recording a local version of the files so i could make a timelapse video later knowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more selfconscious about my computer use as if someone was watching over my shoulder it made me realize that sometimes i spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks i ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way i wanted itll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it and that i do way too many typos where writing code i pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it my own stream was probably boring to watch since i was coding for the most time but livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too it was great seeing other people working i had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time its actually a bit sad because if i could i could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working but i had to do my own work so id only do it once in a while when resting for a bit design although i wanted some simple lowfi highcontrast kind of design i ended up going with somewhat realistic vector art i think it worked very well fitting the mood of the game but i also went overboard for example to know the state of a plate who owns it whos conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it which pasta units are in the queue etc you have to look at the plates bill the problem i realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill they think its some kind of prop so they never actually read its details plus if youre zoomed out too much you cant actually read it so its hard to know whats going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate one other solution that didnt turn out to be as perfect as i thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to in the game thats indicated by the plates decoration its color denotes the team owner but its something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it until they were told about it in the end the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care things that are very important risk becoming background noise unless the player knows its importance originally i wanted to avoid any kind of headsup display in my game in the end i ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned as well as the hideous outofplaceandstillnotobvious call waiter button but in hindsight i should have gone with a simple hud from the start especially one that indicated each teams colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out development development went fast but not fast enough even though i worked around 32 hours for this ludum dare the biggest problem i had to face in the end was overscoping i had too much planned and couldnt get it all done contentwise i had several kinds of pasta planned wikipedia is just amazing in that regard split into several different groups from small pastina to huge pasta al forno but because of time constraints i ended up scratching most of them and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta barely something to start when talking about the evolution of pasta pastas used in the game unfortunately the macs where never used which is one of the saddest things about the project really it had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there but i just didnt have time to draw the rest of the assets needed something i loved to do by the way other nonobvious features had to be dropped too for example when ordering some pasta you were supposed to select what kind of sauce youd like with your pasta each with different attributes bolognese for example is very strong but inaccurate pesto is very accurate and has great range but its weaker and my favorite vodka would triggers 10 loss of speed on the pasta hit by it the code for that is mostly in there but in the end i didnt have time to implement the sauce selection interface all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce todo list lots of things were not done actual programming also took a toll in the development time having been programming for a while i like to believe i got to a point where i know how to make things right but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way what i mean is that i had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time eg a lot of singletons references for crosscommunication rather than events or observers allencompassing check loops not fast enough that left a very sour taste in my mouth while i know i used to do those a few years ago and survive i almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now at the same time i do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe one small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me thats starling the accelerated graphics framework i used in flash i had tested it before and i knew how to use it well the api is very similar to flash itself however there were some small details that had some impact during development making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time i was writing the game it was again the right thing to do but i should have used starling more deeply before which is the conundrum i used it for ludum dare just so i could learn more about it argument and user experience one final aspect of the game that i learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun if you have to spend the longest time explaining things your game is doing something wrong and thats exactly the problem survival of the tastiest ultimately faced its very hard for people to understand whats going on with the game why and how i did have some introductory text at the beginning but that was a lastminute thing more importantly i should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand that doesnt mean the game itself should be simple it just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable conclusion im extremely happy with what ive done and especially given that this was my first ludum dare however i feel like ive learned a lot of what not to do the biggest problem is overscoping like eric decker said the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something halfassed im sure i will do more ludum dares in the future but if there are any lessons i can take of it they are to make it simple to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with otherwise youll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only that way you can actually take two days and make it cool this entry was posted on

allowed 3 responses to survival of the tastiest postmortem darn it knowing that i missed your livestream makes me a sad panda but more to the point the game is well for a startup its original to say the least d it has some really neat ideas and more importantly its designed arround touch screens whitch by the looks of the submission is something rare o or that could be just me and my short memory

This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\\n\\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\\n\\nDecree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922\\n\\nDecree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931\\n\\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\\n\\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\\n\\nFor the provision:\\n• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health\\n• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\\n• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\\n• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\\n• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\\n• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\\n\\nAgainst the provision:\\n• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\\n• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\\n• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\\n• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\\n• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\\n\\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\\n\\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.\\n\\nThe top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:—Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).\\n\\nThe nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.\\n\\nFor the complete list of the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team.\\n\\nSelected players\\n\\nPete Rose controversy\\nThere was controversy over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.  After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later.  On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography My Prison Without Bars.\\n\\nSee also\\nMajor League Baseball All-Time Team, a
